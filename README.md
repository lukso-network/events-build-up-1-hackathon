### BUILD THE NEXT GENERATION OF DAPPS ON UNIVERSAL PROFILES

Along with the launch of LUKSOâ€™s L16 Public Testnet, weâ€™re excited to announce a 6-week online hackathon â€“ the first LUKSO Build UP!

Build on [Universal Profiles (UPs)](https://docs.lukso.tech/standards/universal-profile/introduction), by exploring and utilizing [LUKSO standard proposals (LSPs)](https://docs.lukso.tech/standards/universal-profile/introduction) as well as our developer tools and libraries.
- The current standards widely used in blockchain today are inflexible and limited. LSPs are the building blocks of the LUKSO ecosystem which enable developers to create more user friendly and interactive applications
- Universal Profiles are smart contract based accounts that leverage multiple LSPs to improve the blockchain user experience and onboarding into Web3. They are easy to create and allow creators, brands and users to explore the multiverse with a long lasting, reputable and interoperable digital identity

Join us in shaping the New Creative Economy and changing blockchain for everyone!
